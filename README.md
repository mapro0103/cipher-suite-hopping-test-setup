# TLS Cipher-Suite-Hopping Covert Channel

This repository contains all relevant scripts, test environment configurations, and tool implementations for the TLS Cipher-Suite-Hopping Covert Channel project.

## Repository Contents

This research project demonstrates a novel covert channel technique that leverages TLS cipher suite selection patterns to encode and transmit hidden data. The repository includes:

- Implementation of the covert channel sender and receiver
- Network monitoring and analysis tools
- Test environment setup utilities
- Performance analysis scripts

The included components allow researchers to reproduce the experiments, analyze the covert channel's capacity, and understand its technical implementation.

## Educational Purpose

This implementation is provided strictly for academic research and educational purposes only.
